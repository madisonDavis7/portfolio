    <h1 class="project-title">About the Project</h1>
    <div class="about-box">
        <p class="about-p">This simulator was done for a class assignment in my first Java class.
            The user picks some moves and puts them in via the command line. The program then reads this,
            does the opposite of each move, and solves the cube given the state by the user. It's a fairly
            long program and not optimized but gets the job done. It was a project aimed at letting us explore
            and object-oriented langauge and get comfortable with classes and methods.

                This project was made purely in <b class="pk">Java</b> and has no frontend component. It is run and
                interacted
                with solely through the <b class="pk">command line</b>. This allowed me to experience a more robust
                language and
                made for an interesting time trying to format things in a way that made sense.

                Though this project doesn't really have a user base outside of me, I did have to think about
                how to best print the <b class="pk">string</b> outputs to the command line in a way that made sense for
                a cube. I
                wanted
                users to be able to <b class="pk">easily</b> see the moves they make printed out, along with the
                resulting cube.

                    The wireframe for this simulator is very basic and only needed to cover how I wanted things
                    to be printed out on the command line. I wanted it <b class="pk">simple</b>, easy to follow, and <b
                        class="pk">not
                        cluttered</b>.
                    I used <b class="pk">Figma</b> for this process. Each side of the cube was going to be represented
                    by nine
                    letters,
                    each representing a colored cube on that side. In order to show the whole cube each side would be
                    printed in a column.

                This was my first real project using Java and took many hours to complete. I had issues with not only a
                new language, but
                visualizing the cube itself in order to translate it into code. I ended up getting a physical Rubik's
                Cube and labeling
                each side with a number to figure out the moves I needed to program. I struggled in the beginning with
                organizing my thoughts and putting them into code, learning the syntax, and getting the moves to work.
                It was
                a new experience to run my code from the command line as well and often forgot to X-UA-Compatible
                my project first, up until this project I was solely using python and
                running projects with the Python IDE.

                By going through this project I was able to dive into classes, OOP, and translating a physical movement
                into code.
                I learned a lot about organizing my code to be optimized for many calls to the same method. It was a
                learning experience
                for a new language and let me dive in with a fun project. I learned a lot about project management,
                planning out my process, and
                how to break down a large project into smaller pieces.
