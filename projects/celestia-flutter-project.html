        <p class="about-p">
            This project was the second version of my Celestia app. It was also for my Advanced Web Development class
            and was
            meant to be a chance to learn a new framework. I wanted to keep things similar but didn't end up having a
            map to
            show the ISS's location.

                This app was created using <b class="pk">Flutter</b> and <b class="pk">Dart</b>. I used Flutter to
                create
                the app and Dart as the main programming language. Because of Flutter's pre-built <b
                    class="pk">widgets</b>, I didn't need
                as much
                CSS to get the desired layout. Using widgets was much quicker and cleaner as well.

                Similar to the first Celestia app, I wanted this one to have the same <b class="pk">aesthetic</b> and
                appeal. The only difference was
                the
                map, in this app I didn't include a map with the location. I wanted to test out a <b
                    class="pk">cleaner</b> version and
                wasn't
                satisfied with the map api in the previous app.

                    The wireframe for this app was created in Figma and was modeled after the first Celestia wireframe.
                    I just made a few tweaks to the location page, adding the ISS location button and removing the
                    spot for the map. I kept it simple and clear, adding in some placeholder text and rough shapes
                    for the
                    buttons.

                When creating this app my first obstacle was using a new language and framework. It took lots of
                research
                and time to get used to the syntax and uuse of widgets, it was a new experience and made the simple
                layout
                take more time and effort. My other major problem was getting the Google Maps API to work with Flutter,
                it
                is a known issue that they aren't always compatible. In the end I decided to not include a map and
                instead
                have a button that users could click to get the ISS's location. This way the app still looked complete,
                accomplished
                its goal, and I didn't have to spend more time trying to get the map to work.

            <p class="learned-txt">
                Because this was my first time using Flutter, I learned a lot about the framework and how to use it. I
                got some
                experience with widgets and planning my layout in terms of layers and heiarchy. I also learned more
                about incorporating
                APIs into my app. Though I didn't get the map to work, along the way I learned that some frameworks and
                APIs aren't
                compatible with eachother and that many forums will have other options. It was a lot of research,
                documentation, and
                trial and error to get the desired app.
