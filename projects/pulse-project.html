            Pulse is a music portfolio I created to work on my skills. It's a personal project meant to demonstrate my
            ability
            to create visually appealing portfolio for potential clients. It took a few weeks to complete and went
            through many design
            iterations as I found what did and did not work.

                This is a pretty basic website made with HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. I wanted to kep the tech
                stack
                simple and focus more on the design process and not the technical difficulty itself. My main goal for
                this was
                to really put thought into the colors, typography, visuals, and overall user experience.

                When I started the creative process I created a mood board to help me visualize the direction I wanted
                to go. My aim for this project was to dedicate time to the design and feel of the site itself. I focused
                the
                creative process, user research, and having a fully thought out plan before I began coding.

                    The wireframe for this idea went through many changes as I tried out different layouts. I wanted it
                    to be fairly minimal
                    and modern, but also have sufficient text space. The whole design process was done in Figma, from my
                    inspiration page to
                    the various wireframes for different screen sizes. I needed to make sure that for every device and
                    possible display size,
                    the layout was clean and responsive.

                <p class="box-par two">
                    When I began this website my first step was a mood board to get a feel for the tone I wanted to set
                    for users.
                    I spent many hours on Pinterest and searching through various photography sites to find images,
                    color palettes, and
                    typography that fit what I had in mind. I knew I wanted it to be a darker background with some
                    bright colors that popped and
                    contrasted well. The portfolio was designed for an edm artist and I needed that to be reflected in
                    the design. The first step is to get an idea, I through everything onto one page and use elements
                    from different
                    images to create a cohesive design.
