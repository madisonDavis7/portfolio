            Pulse is a music portfolio I created to work on my skills. It's a personal project meant to demonstrate my
            ability
            to create visually appealing portfolio for potential clients. It took a few weeks to complete and went
            through many design
            iterations as I found what did and did not work.

                This is a pretty basic website made with HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. I wanted to kep the tech
                stack
                simple and focus more on the <b class="pk">design process</b> and not the technical difficulty itself.
                My main goal for
                this was
                to really put thought into the colors, <b class="pk">typography</b>, visuals, and overall user
                experience.

                When I started the creative process I created a <b class="pk">mood board</b> to help me visualize the
                direction I wanted
                to go. My aim for this project was to dedicate time to the design and feel of the site itself. I focused
                on
                the
                creative process, user research, and having a fully thought out <b class="pk">plan</b> before I began
                coding.

                    The wireframe for this idea went through many changes as I tried out different layouts. I wanted it
                    to be fairly minimal
                    and modern, but also have sufficient text space. The whole design process was done in Figma, from my
                    inspiration page to
                    the various wireframes for different screen sizes. I needed to make sure that for every device and
                    possible display size,
                    the layout was clean and responsive.

                    When I began this website my first step was a mood board to get a feel for the tone I wanted to set
                    for users.
                    I spent many hours on Pinterest and searching through various photography sites to find images,
                    color palettes, and
                    typography that fit what I had in mind. I knew I wanted it to be a darker background with some
                    bright colors that popped and
                    contrasted well. The portfolio was designed for an edm artist and I needed that to be reflected in
                    the design. The first step is to get an idea, I through everything onto one page and use elements
                    from different
                    images to create a cohesive design.

                While creating this website there weren't a ton of technical problems I encountered. In terms of issues
                with styling,
                I had the most trouble with the fade in animation for my image break. Adding in the fade effects was
                something I hadn't done
                before and definitely had a learning curve. Through trial and error I eventually figured it out. The
                issue was the white background
                that was visible before the image was fully faded in. The rest of the website is black so the white was
                unwanted. It ended up
                being a simple fix, but finding what exactly I needed to change was a challenge. It was a learning
                experience and let me gain more
                skills in both adding simple animations, but also using the browser tools to debug the issue.

            <p class="learned-txt">This project taught be a lot about the design process and how important having a
                fully
                thought out plan is. I spent a lot of time just getting an idea of what I wanted, finding websites to
                help with inspiration,
                researching typography, and creating several wireframes before deciding which felt right for the message
                I wanted to convey. I think taking the time to research, plan, and strategize my course of action let me
                avoid
                being overwhelmed with ideas. Before starting this project I watched a video course on the design
                process, hosted by a
                professional, that really enlightened me as to how the industry tackles projects.This website ended up
