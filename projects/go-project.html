            This game was also a class assignment. It models a game of Go where the user plays as black
            and goes against the computer who plays as white. After each move I wnated the board to be
            printed out so it was easier to keep track of where pieces were and how far alongt he game was.
            I had never heard of Go before this project but it was a lot of fun to code something that was both
            enjoyable to interact with but was challenging to play.

                This project was made using only <b class="pk">Java</b> and was interacted with only through the command
                line. It
                has no user interface.
                The visual part comes from strings printed to the command line. For this I used <b class="pk">Java,
                    Visual Studio
                    Code, and terminal</b>. To figure out the game itself I did quite a bit of research on the legal
                moves and plays.
                I also made sure to use the crrect jargon when naming my methods.

                The userbase for this game would really only be me or my classmates. For the organization of the output
                I
                was more inspired by terminal than the users. I knew I needed to keep things <b class="pk">clean,
                    simple</b>, and
                not
                clutter the
                screen. I wanted the board to be printed out in a way that was easy to read and see exactly where the
                pieces
                were. Because I could only use characters and had no GUI I had limited options to make a labeled board.

                    The wireframe for this also used <b class="pk">Figma</b> and was very simple. I wanted it to say
                    when each
                    player went,
                    ask for their moves in terms of X and Y coordinates, and print out the score. After each turn I
                    wanted the board
                    to be printed out with all the pieces and available places. Though the wireframe wasn't much, it
                    helped my <b class="pk">visualize</b>
                    how I wanted users to interact with the game.

                When doing this project I had similar issues to the first Java project I made. There was a learning
                curve with classes, especially
                variables and their scopes. This game was also fairly difficult in terms of translating the rules into
                code. I had never played
                Go before so the rules were new to me and confusing to understand. Because pieces can be taken I had to
                make sure the score and
                board reflected that. There were also several bigs that came up with taking pieces and placing pieces in
                areas they were not allowed.
                It took many hours of debugging but I was able to get the scoring correct, banned moves fixed, and the
                board to update correctly.

            <p class="learned-txt">
                I learned quite a bit with this project, mainly with strings, formatting, and lists. For the pieces I
                used lists to keep track of what
                pieces were in play, which had been checked, and which were dead. The board itself was also an array of
                lists. There was a learning
                curve with ensuring everything was updated and formatted right. I dealt a lot with conditionals and
                making them optimized, instead of
                having uncessarily long and nested conditionals. In terms of printing to the command line I was able to
                get
                experience with formatting strings and printing repeated statements to alter the size of the board. This
                was one of my
                first applications of nested for loops.
