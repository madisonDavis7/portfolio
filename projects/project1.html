    <div class="about-box">
        <p class="about-p">This project is a dynamic web app inspired by a travel guide. It was a space travel guide
            that also served as a way to learn about the galaxy, particularly a few planets, exoplanets, stars, and
            constellations. I wanted it to be colorful and have a theme reminiscent
            of the Milky Way.

                This project used several tools to create a seamless user experience. I wanted the layout to be simple
                and easy to navigate. The stack used consists of <b>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</b>. The Django framework
                was
                used
                to create the backend and serve the pages.

                Before beginning this project I had to think about what the userbase would be and what experience I
                wanted to create. This app was made for a college class with <b>galactic</b> inspiration. I wanted the
                color pallete to be <b>bright</b> and colorful, but not overwhelming.

                    The wireframe for this app was made with <b>Figma</b> and went through many changes.
                    I wanted the layout to be <b>minimalistic</b> and tie into the theme. I kept the pages
                    identical in layout and changed the data to match the tour. This <b>symmetry</b> keeps it
                    clean and modern.

                While designing and building this app there were several issues that came up. It was the first time I
                had
                used Django
                and there was a learning curbve there, especially regarding the database. I originally created it as a
                static app, then
                realized I needed it to be dynamic and had to redo everything I had just done. This was also the first
                time I had
                integrated an api into a project. It took many trials to get the api to work successfully and update
                each day.

                This project allowed me to learn a lot about dynamic apps, databases, and using a framework. I also
                got experience with user authentication, login, signup, and password resets. This was the first complete
                webapp
                I had done and I learned a lot about the process. In addition I got comfortable using and navigating
                GitHub, especially
                in collaboration with other people working on the app.
