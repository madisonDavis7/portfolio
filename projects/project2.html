    <div class="about-box">
        <p class="about-p">This simulator was done for a class assignment in my first Java class.
            The user picks some moves and puts them in via the command line. The program then reads this,
            does the opposite of each move, and solves the cube given the state by the user. It's a fairly
            long program and not optimized but gets the job done. It was a project aimed at letting us explore
            and object-oriented langauge and get comfortable with classes and methods.

                This project was made purely in Java and has no frontend component. It is run and interacted
                with solely through the command line. This allowed me to experience a more robust language and
                made for an interesting time trying to format things in a way that made sense.

                Though this project doesn't really have a user base outside of me, I did have to think about
                how to best print the outputs to the command line in a way that made sense for a cube. I wanted
                users to be able to easily see the moves they make printed out, along with the resulting cube.

                    The wireframe for this simulator is very basic and only needed to cover how I wanted things
                    to be printed out on the command line. I wanted it simple, easy to follow, and not cluttered.
                    I used Figma for this process. Each side of the cube was going to be represented by nine letters,
                    each representing a colored cube on that side. In order to show the whole cube each side would be
                    printed in a column.

                While designing and building this app there were several issues that came up. It was the first time I
                had
                used Django
                and there was a learning curbve there, especially regarding the database. I originally created it as a
                static app, then
                realized I needed it to be dynamic and had to redo everything I had just done. This was also the first
                time I had
                integrated an api into a project. It took many trials to get the api to work successfully and update
                each day.

                This project allowed me to learn a lot about dynamic apps, databases, and using a framework. I also
                got experience with user authentication, login, signup, and password resets. This was the first complete
                webapp
                I had done and I learned a lot about the process. In addition I got comfortable using and navigating
                GitHub, especially
                in collaboration with other people working on the app.
