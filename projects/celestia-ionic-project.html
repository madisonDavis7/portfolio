    <div class="about-box">
        <p class="about-p">
            This project was made for my Advanced Web Development class. I wanted it to be simple and easy to navigate.
            The goal
            was to make a pretty and functional app that could educate users on some basic facts about the planets in
            our solar system. I wanted it to be a kid friendly app and something I could show and utilize when I work
            with children. It was important to me that I made it interactive and able to hold a child's short attention
            span.

                The app was made using <b>React</b> and <b>Ionic</b>. I used React to create the app and Ionic to make
                it aesthetically how I wanted.
                I mainly used <b>TypeScript</b>, but also had some <b>JavaScript, CSS</b>, and <b>HTML</b> to achieve
                the
                desired look. To
                host the app I
                used <b>Firebase</b> while the backend uses <b>FireStore</b>. My build tool for this was <b>Vite</b>.

                When designing this app and thinking about the userbase, I didn't really have one in mind. My only goal
                for
                users was to have it usable for <b>younger</b> ages as well. I wanted it <b>fun</b> to navigate and easy
                to follow. I work with
                younger and kids with space often so that was my target age range. I knew I needed it to be simple,
                <b>colorful</b>, have images and
                less text, and have a <b>interactive</b> features to keep attention, so I added clickable images,
                animations, and a zoomable map.

        <div class="wf-col">
            <div class="theme-box">
                <p class="box-par">
                    My wireframe was created using <b>paper and pencil</b> first, just to get some ideas down, then I
                    moved to <b>Figma</b> to get
                    a cleaner idea of what I wanted. For the most part the design was simple, I knew I wanted a landing
                    page with only the title,
                    a navigation page with each planet, and that the last page would be a map of some sorts. Each planet
                    would have the same
                    <b>base layout</b>, but with unique content. I wanted the color palette to be dark so that the
                    planets
                    stood out.
                    It was critical that the planet images were the highlight of the page, leading me making them
                    enlarge when
                    hovered over.

                My main issues when it came it this project were using a new framework and langauge, and getting my APIs
                to work. This app
                uses two, one for the map, Google Maps API, and one for the ISS's location, Where the ISS at. I ran into
                several issues
                where my code was expecting a string but was getting an integer, or vice versa. I ended up having some
                checks to ensure the data
                being passed from the API was a string, and if not I converted it. I had the most issues with the pam
                though, getting the
                dot to show up on the map and update as the location did was difficult, especially because the dot only
                showed up when the app
                was deployed, not served locally. Eventually I was able to get it to work successfully.

                As this was my first time using most of these tools there was a learning curve for sure. I think the one
                skill I gained the most from was hosting on Firebase. I had never hosted an app before and now looking
                back
                I have continued to use Firebase and gotten more famaliar with Functions, Hosting, and navigating the
                console. This
                was also the first time I had used Typescript and I enjoyed it. Being the first complete app I had
                created, and using
                Ionic and React to help, I was able to experience a framework and library and get to understand how they
                work and why
                they are useful.
