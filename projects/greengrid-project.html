            This website was a side project I designed in order to work on my skills. I created fake company, GreenGrid,
            focused on
            clean and renewable energy. I wanted to design a webiste for a company and be able to walk through the
            entire process. I chose
            to create a compnay I thought would be neat to have as a client, and one that would work with the theme I
            had in mind.

                For this website I did more user research to understand what the target audience would be. Because I was
                approaching
                this as I would a client project, I needed it to reflect the <b class="pk">company's mission</b> and be
                modern in its
                design. I found that my users
                would be interested in the environment, a <b class="pk">minimalistic</b> design would get to the point,
                and that it needed
                to be appealing to adults. All this
                led me to having a single page website with no animations, <b class="pk">few colors</b>, and images that
                drew in the
                audience.

                    The process for this website was more in depth than my previous ones. I spent a long time
                    <b class="pk">researching</b> and
                    looking for inspiration for the theme and tone I wanted. I started off with a <b class="pk">rough
                        sketch</b> of the
                    layout on paper and then moved to Figma to create a more detailed and polished wireframe. Then I
                    went
                    in and added all my images, <b class="pk">fonts</b>,<b class="pk">logo</b>, and other details so it
                    resembled the complete product.

                When I had the idea for this website I knew I wanted it to have a sleek and modern feel to it. I wanted
                there
                to be lots of whitespace, a clean layout, elegant font, and images to break up the text. I spent some
                time going through
                Pinterest and other sites getting inspiration. I chose my intro image and used that to pick the three
                colors for my
                palette. I knew I wanted an accent color and ended up choosing a light green to be both the logo color
                and
                accent color on the site.

                As a learning experience this project was very beneficial, especially in terms of the design process.
                Before this site my wireframes
                were almost too basic and I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted. For this one though I had two
                wireframes, one basic and
                just a brief layout, and one with all the images, text, and colors. Going through the full process let
                me learn how long it could take as well. In terms
                of the coding, I got more experience with CSS in terms of making a responsive website. I used media
                queries quite often and made sure that the site looked
                good on any size screen. I also gained experience in forms, styling them, and incorporating them into my
                sites.
