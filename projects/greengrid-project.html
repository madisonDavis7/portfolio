            This website was a side project I designed in order to work on my skills. I created fake company, GreenGrid,
            focused on
            clean and renewable energy. I wanted to design a webiste for a company and be able to walk through the
            entire process. I chose
            to create a compnay I thought would be neat to have as a client, and one that would work with the theme I
            had in mind.

                For this website I did more user research to understand what the target audience would be. Because I was
                approaching
                this as I would a client project, I needed it to reflect the company's mission and be modern in its
                design. I found that my users
                would be interested in the environment, a minimalistic design would get to the point, and that it needed
                to be appealing to adults. All this
                led me to having a single page website with no animations, few colors, and images that drew in the
                audience.

                    The process for this website was more in depth than my previous ones. I spent a long time
                    researching and
                    looking for inspiration for the theme and tone I wanted. I started off with a rough sketch of the
                    layout on paper and then moved to figma to create a more detailed and polished wireframe. Then I
                    went
                    in and added all my images, fonts, logo, and other details so it resembled the complete product.

                My main issues when it came it this project were using a new framework and langauge, and getting my APIs
                to work. This app
                uses two, one for the map, Google Maps API, and one for the ISS's location, Where the ISS at. I ran into
                several issues
                where my code was expecting a string but was getting an integer, or vice versa. I ended up having some
                checks to ensure the data
                being passed from the API was a string, and if not I converted it. I had the most issues with the pam
                though, getting the
                dot to show up on the map and update as the location did was difficult, especially because the dot only
                showed up when the app
                was deployed, not served locally. Eventually I was able to get it to work successfully.

                As this was my first time using most of these tools there was a learning curve for sure. I think the one
                skill I gained the most from was hosting on Firebase. I had never hosted an app before and now looking
                back
                I have continued to use Firebase and gotten more famaliar with Functions, Hosting, and navigating the
                console. This
                was also the first time I had used Typescript and I enjoyed it. Being the first complete app I had
                created, and using
                Ionic and React to help, I was able to experience a framework and library and get to understand how they
                work and why
                they are useful.
