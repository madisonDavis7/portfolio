        <p class="about-p">
            This was a fun side project I worked on after being inspired by a simulation made by someone else. I have a
            strong
            interest in space and this was a cool way to combine my interest in space with my interest in programming. I
            wanted it to
            be relatively simple in regards to the visuals and code, but I also wanted to make it as accurate as
            possible in terms of scale.

                This project used several languages to achieve the orbiting effect, including <b class="pk">HTML,
                    CSS</b>, and
                <b class="pk">JavaScript</b>. The project was built using HTML for the structure, CSS
                for the
                styling, and
                JavaScript for the stars. Most of this project's appeal is due to the animation styles applied.

                Becuase this was a personal project I had more freedom in terms of <b class="pk">visuals</b> and <b
                    class="pk">tone</b>. I
                didn't need to
                think
                about users and do research into the userbase. I mainly wanted to keep the highlight on the orbits and
                not have anything
                extra cluttering the screen.

                    This wireframe was made using <b class="pk">Figma</b> and was more of a rough idea of something to
                    look at. I
                    wanted each planet to be an image with a size relatively to scale. The wireframe for this project
                    was
                    more a <b class="pk">layout</b> than a full design but it was still good practice, both in using
                    Figma and
                    having a
                    creative
                    process when working on a new idea.

                When working on this project I ran into several issues with getting my idea to work using only HTML/CSS.
                I didn't use JavaScript for any of the orbits so I had to be creative. I also ran into a few
                problems getting the speeds to be proportional.
                Because I'm relatively new to Javascript I had issues with the syntax in general, I was used to coding
                more physics oriented programs
                in Python.

                I learned a lot about JavaScript and the syntax. The JavaScript was only used to create
                my background stars and was pretty short in terms of lines of code, but
                it was a good learning experience for creating objects. In terms of styling, this was the first time I
                had
                used the CSS animation style
                in a project. I was exposed to some new style techniques and how to use them. This was also the first
                project that I had to do quite a bit
                of research into the code itself, I spent many hours looking at similar projects, debugging, and
                figuring out what my error messages
                meant. This taught me how to better my keywords when I searched and how to look for reputable sources.
